   Simple to write and understand
   Has powerful libraries like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and pyautogui
   Perfect for connecting webcam input with game control

2. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) 📷

    A library for real-time image and video processing. It can:
      Capture video from your webcam
